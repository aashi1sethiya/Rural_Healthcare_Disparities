# Rural_Healthcare_Disparities

## The curious case of Rural healthcare: What do you see??
### 15-20%  (more than 46 million Americans) live in rural areas 

## Rural areas:
Sparsely populated
Low housing density
Distant from urban centers (geographic isolation)



# Characteristics of Rural Areas in the United States
Rural areas make up 97% of country land mass, but only about 15-20% of the population lives in these areas. 


## Distinguishing between Rural and Urban 

## US Census: 

Strictly based on measures of population size and density

## Health Disparities/Challenges in North Carolina: Urban vs Rural 
Fewer residents with health insurance 
Higher percentage of drug overdoses 
Hospital closures
Lack of providers 
(Baxley, 2023)

## Rural vs. Urban Communities: Key Differences in Healthcare
Mortality rates higher than urban counterparts
Unintentional injury deaths 
Overdoses
Chronic conditions
Older and sicker populations
Inadequate access to healthcare
Healthcare staffing shortages


## Rural Health Disparities: Overview/Consequences

Geographic Causes: Rural areas are far from healthcare facilities 

Lack of transportation - isolation, emergency situations

Healthcare personnel shortage - struggle to attract & retain HCWs. 
PCP: Patient ratio = 40/100,000 in rural areas VS 53/100,000 in urban areas.



## Contributing Factors
making it difficult for residents to access medical care, especially in emergencies.
as individuals may struggle to reach healthcare providers or hospitals. 
The geographic remoteness, the lack of amenities & Limited career opportunities in some regions can discourage HCWs from practicing there. 
HCWs can choose not to work in rural areas. 


### Health Insurance Gap 

Low income rural areas - High uninsured or underinsured individuals
Limiting their ability to access healthcare services. 
Low medicaid expansion - like in NC - we haven’t expanded yet!
Contributing Factors



## Rural Health Disparities: Solutions & Interventions

### Telemedicine and Telehealth Programs

It’s expansion since the early 2000s, but adoption surged during COVID-19 in 2020

Investment in Digital health & the health revenues of telehealth players almost doubled coupled to 2019


**Challenge:**
Lack of broadband internet access in rural areas
“FCC reported that over 14 M rural Americans lacked access to broadband”

**Solution for replicability:**
Federal funding of $7.1 billion allocated in the ARPA for expanding rural broadband access
Leveraging satellite and wireless technologies
More programs designed to support sub-acute, moderate and chronic conditions via a tele-health medium


On-demand virtual urgent care 
Virtual office visits 
Virtual home health services
Tech-enabled home medication administration 


### Rural Health Clinics (RHCs)

As of 2020, more than 4,000 certified RHCs were operational across the U.S., offering vital primary care services to millions in underserved areas

**Challenge:** 
Recruiting and retaining healthcare providers in rural settings (due to isolation and limited professional opportunities)

**Solution for replicability:**
Incentive programs - loan forgiveness, scholarship initiatives
Increased reimbursement rates
Collaborative partnerships with medical schools to create a sustainable pipeline of rural healthcare professionals


### Community Health Workers (CHWs)

Trusted local residents who provide healthcare education, outreach, and navigation services within rural communities

**Challenge:**
Funding and sustainability issues in resource-constrained rural communities

**Solution for Replicability:**
Leverage federal and state grants, private donations
Medicaid reimbursement 
Community engagement 
Local buy-in is crucial for long-term sustainability
A 2017 study published in Health Affairs reported that CHW interventions led to a 30% reduction in hospital readmissions and a 13% reduction in emergency department visits among Medicaid beneficiaries, illustrating their impact on health outcomes

### Mobile Clinics

Healthcare facilities on wheels, equipped with medical staff and equipment, delivering services directly to rural communities

In 2019, mobile clinics provided care to > 5 M patients through approx 8.7 million visits, offering services like vaccinations and preventive care


**Challenge:**
Maintaining funding and resources for mobile clinics for long term

**Solution for Replicability:**
Diversifying funding sources
Including public and private partnerships, grants
Integrating telehealth for certain services
Conducting regular assessments of community needs ensures services remain relevant

### Loan Forgiveness Programs

Loan Forgiveness Programs incentivize healthcare professionals to serve in rural areas in exchange for student loan forgiveness.

(NHSC) reported in 2019 that NHSC clinicians served nearly 13.7 million patients, with 84% of them in rural or underserved areas

**Challenge:** 
Ensuring equitable distribution of healthcare providers across rural regions 

**Solution for Replicability:**
Prioritizing loan forgiveness in medically underserved areas can help address regional disparities in provider distribution
